For now, I want us to think of databases in relation to regular text files
It's like storing data in Microsoft Excel instead of Microsoft Word

SQL:

1. Store large amounts of data
2. Easier to access said data
3. More efficient than using a TXT file (they are actually stored on a tree)
4. SQL is what we call a 'relational database' - a table in SQL can be related to another table
    a. We can join multiple tables in a query when we need data from both tables
5. TCL and ACID compliance - it largely has to do with how multiple separate operations on our data interact with each
    other in such a way that operations are predictable, consistent, and correct

Store groceries
Store recipies
    Many recipies can have many groceries
Store supermarkets

    Groceries can have different prices at different supermarkets

GROCERIES
Grocery name
List of supermarkets sold at
List of prices at each supermarket
Food type

    For example: the colum
