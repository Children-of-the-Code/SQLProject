Docker is a containerization tool
A container is similar to a virtual machine, in that it is a virtualized environment
But, where a virtual machine simulates an operating system's entire hardware,
we can say that a container only virtualized software, because it's able to reuse the computer's
core operating system functions like memory management

Docker does quite a lot.. similarly to github or maven, it also maintains remote and local
repositories of something called an image : an image is a blueprint for a container

(we can even prove instructions for how an image should be made using something
called a dockerfile - we'll get into this in a couple weeks)



docker pull - pulls an image from dockerhub
docker run - create and run container (will pull automatically)
docker start - start stopped container
docker kill - kill container
docker container rm - remove stopped container

-p - designate ports
-d - run in background
-e - set an environment variable for the container
--name - set the name for the container

#RUN THIS!
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=P@SSWORD123" -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
